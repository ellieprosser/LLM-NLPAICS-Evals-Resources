# Scenario 1
Participant x = caitp
Participant y = jgraham
### Normal adult-adult 1
> caitp: http doesn't care, and xhr doesn't care, so it's not clear why we're making any assertion in the first place
>
> jgraham: Anyway what zcorpan says in that bug is right
>
> jgraham: The goal is to get interop
>
> caitp: yes, I agree with that
>
> caitp: but my position is still that we should be testing compliance with the spec
>
> caitp: not with a particular implementation
>
> jgraham: In this case it seems like specs are half-assing things and we should just agree what the right behaviour is and get everyone to implement it
>
> jgraham: We're not
>
> jgraham: You are assuming some sort of malice here when there is none
>
> caitp: oh no no no
>
> caitp: i'm not assuming malice
>
> caitp: it's not "malice", it seems like an honest mistake, like maybe it's testing something that should be specified but isn't
>
> caitp: but regardless, no implementation that I've seen (not tested netsurf, does netsurf even have XHR yet?) passes that test, apart from gecko
>
> caitp: the comment which explains this reasoning for this behaviour in chromium is interesting, I linked to it in either the issue or PR
